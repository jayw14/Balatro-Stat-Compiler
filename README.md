Balatro Stat Compiler is a tool designed to show gameplay statistics found within the save files but not normally shown in game. Additionally, this tool offers the ability to compile data between multiple saves in order to view total statistics, something not normally done by other similar applications. The application converts the savefile content into JSON, where it is read and combined into a display similar to the game. *The documentation for the project is still a work in progress*
